Unfortunately I had an SSH key setup with an oldest github account named ryuz4ki, I didn't want to do another commit with this account.
I will only use frnczdvd in the future.

Also I had some time management issues on the week, but I managed to catch up with myself, lots of achievements this week, positive vibes.
